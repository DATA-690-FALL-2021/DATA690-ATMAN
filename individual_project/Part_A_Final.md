# Chart Interpretation:
- The figure elicits that the number of passengers for Brazil and UK were more involved in labour force.

# Conclusion
- From the above Graphs it is very obvious that the number of passengers carried by AirTransport was maximum in USA.
- Next we can conclude that number of passenger carried to different country between the age (20-24) was maximum in Japan inspite of travelling less number of passengers.
- The passengers carried to United Kingdom were more involved in Labour Force whose ages were between 15-24.
